# 51. Creating a "Recipe" Model
- You should define how a recipe looks like because you're going to use it a lot. When we use it in any component, so that we're always talking about the same structure.
- Because of this, you'll need to create a model. A modal is a typescript file. In the recipe folder, create `recipe.model.ts` file. Note that the `model` is optional but you  should be descriptive about what's inside a file.
- Wow, I quickly disabled the TS warning that says file should end with a newline. Now I'm cool.
- Now we've created a recipe model that we can use.
- Let's use it in the next lecture.
