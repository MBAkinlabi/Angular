# 38. Styling Elements Dynamically with ngStyle
- Let's talk about attribute directives
- **Unlike structural directives, attribute directives don't add or remove elements. They only change the element they were placed on**
- `ngStyle` is a built-in directive. You can recognize it from the `ng` that it begins with.
- You can use `background-color` which is normal. Or you use `backgroundColor` which is more of the JS style.
