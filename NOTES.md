# 35. Understanding Directives
- What are Directives?
- Directives are Instructions in the DOM!
- Of course components are directives, but directives with a template.
- There's also directives without a template.
- For example:
```html
<p appTurnGreen>Receives a green background!</p>
```
- `appTurnGreen` is kind of a directive
- We'll learn how to write our own directives later. But there are some built-in directives, which are really useful.
- Let's look at them in the next lecture.
