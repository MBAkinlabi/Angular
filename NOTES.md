# 4. Angular vs Angular 2 vs Angular 9
- AngularJS (Angular 1) was released years ago but it had a lot of performance issues.
- The Angular version you're learning in this course is totally different from that one.
- The had to completely rewrite Angular. Now, the new main version is simply Angular 2
- It was released in 2016.
- We're now working with Angular 9. Since 2, there are just releasing new updates. Nothing special.
- New version comes out every 6 months
