# 40. Outputting Lists with ngFor
- `*ngFor` is also a structural directive. It changes the DOM. That's why we need the `*` in front of it.
- Note that this: `let server of servers` is like looping in the servers. 
- This is an important lecture I must keep in mind. Wow.
- I'm now creating more with just a single click on the button. It's so easy. So cool. I'm creating a list of <app-server> without writing each one out. It's now dynamic. So nice. 
- It's still static though because we can't pass the servername to that component. We'll learn that later in the next section.
