# Where to find the Course Source Code

Do you get some strange error? Are you stuck? 

Have a look at the source code of this course - by comparing it to your code you should be able to quickly find out where your code deviates and what causes the issue!

You can find the source code of each section attached to the last lecture of that section!

Each ZIP file holds code files which you can use to compare your code to it. Or you execute my projects:

1) Extract

2) npm install in the extracted folder

3) ng serve

Got an error related to TypeScript thereafter? 

Run npm install --save-dev-exact typescript@3.4.5 in the same project folder and re-try ng serve.

Got any other problems with the code (e.g. error messages when running it or you don't know how to use it)? Check this thread created by Jost: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/lecture/6709112#questions/8079942
