# 11. A Basic Project Setup using Bootstrap for Styling
- We often start with an empty project in the `app.component.html`. We clear everything we have there after installation.
- You could start a new project with `ng new` if you want to.
- Install Bootstrap so that we don't write all the CSS from scratch. That sounds cool to me.
- `control + c`
- `npm install --save bootstrap@3`
- To use the Bootstrap framework, we have to make `Angular` aware of it.
- Go to `angular.json`
- Go to the `"styles":` in the `"build"` section inside there.
- Add it prior to that `"src/styles.css"` so that we can overide it.
- `"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"`
- `ng serve`
- To confirm if Bootstrap was installed, load the page and go to `Elements` in the Chrome Inspector. In the head section, you should go to the styles section and you should find Bootstrap there.
