# 14. How an Angular App gets Loaded and Started
- Instructor explains the selector in the `app.component.ts` file. That selector is `app-root` the exact same thing in the component inside the index.html file.
- Instructor explaining `main.ts` and the files in the `src/app` expecially looking at that `app.module.ts`
- Learned about the `bootstrap` thing.
- I also noticed that imports like `FormsModule`, `HttpModule` were inside the instructor's screen and not on mine. I may have to put them there if things don't work well later.
- This lecture really explains how `Angular` works looking at the files how to  move from each other and work with each  other. Really nice.
