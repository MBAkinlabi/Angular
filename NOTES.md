# 20. Working with Component Templates
- Instead of using an external template file, we can also use an inline template. Which means we define the `html` code in the TypeScript code.
- If you don't have much `html` code, using an inline template like this might be fine.
- If you have more than three lines of HTML code, then you probably need the `html` file back. 
- Templates must be included.
- You'll learn another way of adding `selector` later.
- Styles are there if you want to use them.
