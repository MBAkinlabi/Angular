# 30. Passing and Using Data with Event Binding
- I spent about 30 minutes addressing the complaints from TSLint. It seems something was wrong. And I just had to do some things to make the linting errors just go away. I know I'm doing the right thing following the instructor. I need to learn more about this TSLinting thing.
- Let's move forward.
- Wow, here's the list of all the events you need. Note that the `()` in Angular is kind of using the `addEventListener` thing. I can see all the events here. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
- So, amazing.
- You learned about `$event` it's a reserved word in Angular. It gives us access to the event data.
- We console.logged the information the event gives us and went to the target where we found the value of what we type. So easy. 
- Now, I learned how much data we can get from the `event`. In fact, we can get all the information about that particular event that was fired. It feels so great to know this right now.
- We help TypeScript know the type of the event by doing this: `this.serverName = (event.target as HTMLInputElement).value;`. It's worth learning more about  this  through Google searches.
- I have here in mind: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44321326/property-value-does-not-exist-on-type-eventtarget-in-typescript
- Wow, now when I'm typing, it appears in the paragraph below the input. Thisis really cool. The process is totally different from the one we do in React. Wow.
