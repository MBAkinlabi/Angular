# 34. Assignment 2 Solution
- I forget to add Bootstrap. Added it.
- It took me a long time to finally install Bootstrap. What I learned was that installing Bootstrap 3 is very easy compared to the other. I still don't know how I'll install Bootstrap 4. I need to research about that.
- But hurray, Bootstrap 3 is working perfectly fine with the project right now.
- Note that on the `(click)` event on the button, we can also call a function there. But if what you want to execute is as simple as this, then I don't see the reason why you should call a separate function there. Create a function there. No reason.
