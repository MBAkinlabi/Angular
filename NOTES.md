# 47. Creating the Components
- The files are always slow to update changes. So, I searched for a solution and I'm now using this:
- `sudo ng serve`
- We can generate components automatically by running this
- `ng g c recipes --skipTests true`
- Note that `--skipTests true` is for preventing the testing file from being generated. We don't need that. (at least not yet.)
- If we want to generate these new files in a sub-folder, which is what we're going to do next:
- We can do it like this:
- `ng g c recipes/recipe-list --skipTests true`
- We also did this:
- `ng g c recipes/recipe-detail --skipTests true`
- We can also create a sub-folder inside another sub-folder
- `ng g c recipes/recipe-list/recipe-item --skipTests true`
- We also generated folders for shopping list. No need to write that too here.
