# 28. Event Binding
- Using `on` as the first word in your method means that you mean some event will call it. Well, it'll still work if you don't use `on` first.
- It's just there. Kind of something Angular developers do.
- `()` means that we're using event binding. 
- Note that you shouldn't put too much logic or code into your template.
- We used `(click)`. Wow that's cool. In React, it's called `onClick`
