# 7. Editing the First App
- We opened the IDE. Recommended VS Code.
- Go to the `src` folder. That's where your app is.
- The default cong does the job, you don't need to edit any of these files.
- Make sure you always keep `http://localhost:4200/` running.
- As long as you're developing, keep it opened.
- Instructor taking the time to explain the files inside the `src/app` and it looks cool. I can already start to understand some things especially in the `app.component.ts` file.
- Learned about `ngModel` for the first time.
- Angular is actually split up into multiple modules or packages and if you want to use them, you need to add them. Great learning about that.
- Seems like I'll like more about TypeScript later or soon through this course or by myself.
