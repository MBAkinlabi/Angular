# 56. Creating an "Ingredient" Model
- `shared` is the folder we're creating for things which are shared acrossed the features or components. 
So, it's better for it to be in a separate folder of its own.
- The `ingredients` model should live in the `shared` folder because it'll be used in multiple components.
- Pay attention to how we created our `Ingredient` model. It's a shortcut. Note that we created the `recipe` model earlier. And this is just the shortcut. Keep that in mind.
