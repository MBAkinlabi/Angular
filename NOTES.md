# 62. Using Augury to Dive into Angular Apps
- This tool: Angular Augury. Googled it.

- Click install. It'll take you to the Chrome store. It's a Chrome extension. 
- I added it.
- It helps you understand your app at run time.
- Wow. Learned a bit of some things to help debug the app. It's a cool nice tool to have for debugging. I look forward to using it of course.
