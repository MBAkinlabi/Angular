# 19. Creating Components with the CLI & Nesting Components
- You can automatically generate a component (an alternative to creating a component manually) by going to the Terminal. Leave the current running terminal that's compiling and displaying the app.
- Then you should type `ng generate component servers`
- You can also use this shortcut:
- `ng g c servers`
- It's going to generate a n new folder with those necessary files for component inside the `src/app` folder.
- It'll generate the `css`, `ts`, `html` and `spec.ts` file which is used for testing. We removed the `spec.ts` file. 
- Now, you see that we created nested components.
