# 44. Planning the App
- The first step when building a app is to plan the structure of the app. Like the components you're going to need
- We talked about the features we're going to build in this app
- Planning the components that'll need in the app
- Another last thing to think about is which modal we'll use. By saying "modal", the instructor means which "data."
- You should watch this lecture to see how the instructor illustrated the app while planning. That could give you more insights into how Angular works.
- Although, you'll learn more about this later
