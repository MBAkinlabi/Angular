# 61. Debugging Code in the Browser Using Sourcemaps
- Sometimes you don't get an error message. 
- But the thing may not be working as you expect. 
- In Chrome, go to `Sources`
- Right there, you'll find all our script bundles.
- Check the `main.bundle.js`
- Find the code similar to your logic code and find the line responsible for what you really want to do that isn't working properly.
- Place a breakpoint there. 
- Something will change.
- It'll jump to the component typescript file itself.
- We could debug the errors there, but there's a problem. If the app is big, it'll be hard, finding the exact code we're looking for in `main.bundle.js`
- So what can we do?
- We can directly access our TypeScript file instead of going to `main.bundle.js` that will save us time and let us do what we want to do quickly.  
- Go to `webpack` in the explorer right there in the `Sources`
- After clicking `webpack`, open the `.` folder
- Then click `src/app`. Then as you're already familiar with the file structure of Angular. You should find your TypeScript file there.
