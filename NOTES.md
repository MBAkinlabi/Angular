# 16. Creating a New Component
- The app component (it's files like html and ts) are the root component of our app).
- Note that when naming your component do it with the name first and `.` next and then `component` and the `ts` file extension. 
- Look at the naming convention too. Must include the name of the component first and followed by `component`. No camelCase.
- Learned about `@` decorator a feature of TS. Need to learn more about it.
- Note that you prefix your selector with `app` first before the name.
- I understand the first main things when creating a new component in Angular.
